For the Physics Group Project about windmill turbines
Yassine did Paris, I did La Rochelle and Elise did Nimes. First, each student analysed the data in their dataset. Secondly, analyzed different wind turbine models: Alstom ECO122, Enercon 33 and Aventa AV7. Thirdly, we compared our chosen cities to see, whether it's plausible to power them with wind turbines.
